echo "$(tail -10 myFile)" > myFile  # where 10 is the number of lines I want to keep

You need to use $() for command substitution
bash substitutes that part first and runs the tail command and echo
then it redirects to the same filename.

tail -10 myFile > myFile
will fail and truncate the entire files, this is because the shell opens file descriptor 1 for writing it, in effect truncating it because of the single >, and THEN it executes the tail but the the file has already been emptied so it finds nothing there leaving you with a fully truncated file.  That's why you need the $().
